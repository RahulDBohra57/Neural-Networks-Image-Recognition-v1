## Fashion-MNIST Image Classification App
CNN-based Clothing Recognition with Streamlit

📌 Project Overview

This project is a deep-learning web application that classifies clothing images into 10 Fashion-MNIST categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Users upload a clothing image, and the model predicts the most likely category along with class-wise probabilities through a Streamlit interface.
The model is trained on Fashion-MNIST, a benchmark dataset of grayscale clothing images.

🧠 Dataset (Fashion-MNIST)

Fashion-MNIST consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28×28 pixels) belonging to 10 classes:

Label	Class:
- 0	T-shirt / Top
- 1	Trouser
- 2	Pullover
- 3	Dress
- 4	Coat
- 5	Sandal
- 6	Shirt
- 7	Sneaker
- 8	Bag
- 9	Ankle Boot

⚠️ Important Note

The model is trained on 28×28 grayscale Fashion-MNIST images. Real-world product photos may not always map perfectly because they contain color, lighting, and backgrounds that Fashion-MNIST does not include.
